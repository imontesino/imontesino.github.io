    - title: Bachelor's Thesis (at ENSAM Aix-en-Provence) Point Cloud Generation of as-scaned CAD models for reverse engineering
      year: 2018
      description: Developed a GPU accelerated (CUDA) point cloud generator to create a database of labeled point clouds as one would obtain from hand scanning them. With the objective of generating a dataset to train a PointNet network for reverse engineering purposes. Cutting down processing time per point cloud from 1-2 minutes to less than a second, depending on GPU power.
